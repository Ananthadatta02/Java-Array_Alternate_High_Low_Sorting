# Java-Array_Alternate_High_Low_Sorting
A Java program that rearranges an array in an alternate high-low order. It first sorts the array in ascending order, then reorders elements so the highest appears first, followed by the lowest, then second highest, second lowest, and so on. Uses nested loops for sorting and an alternate placement logic for reordering.
